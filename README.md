This is is a repository for the beginning of me (Daniel/Malgenec) learning SQL and other data-related stuff.
I promise myself to start doing the things I enjoy as my career, which is (surprise surprise) - working with data! So as of 2025.05.13 I officially started studying PostgreSQL.
I believe my mathematical mindset and determination towards the data analysis will be worth every minute spent.
