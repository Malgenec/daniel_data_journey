# daniel_data_journey

This is is a repository for the beginning of me (Daniel/Malgenec) learning SQL and other data-related stuff.

I promise myself to start doing the things I enjoy as my career, which is (surprise surprise) - working with data! So as of 2025.05.13 I officially started studying PostgreSQL.

I believe my mathematical mindset and determination towards the data analysis will be worth every minute spent.

## Why SQL?

**I started learning SQL because:**

- It's a core tool in data analysis, used in applications such as business intelligence, finance reporting, marketing, and practically can be used in all industries
>
- It's essential for querying relational databases like PostgreSQL and integrates well with Python, Excel, and other tools which I already know or going to learn
>
- It enforces structured, logical thinking. Working with data is my passion
>
- I see myself as a person who can present large value in a way that is relevant to this field
