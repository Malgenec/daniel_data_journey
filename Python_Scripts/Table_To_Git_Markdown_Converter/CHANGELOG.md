# Changelog

## v1.1 May 23, 2025

### Added or Changed

- "Remove quotes?" checkbox was divided into two checkboxes: "Remove quotes(headers) and "Remove quotes(data)"
  
- **Added**: Checkbox "Remove quotes(headers)" removes quotes only from the headers
    
- **Added**: Checkbox "Remove quotes(data)" removes quotes only from the data
    
- The "Capitalize headers" checkbox function was **updated**.
  Previously, it capitalized headers only if they did not have quotes in them (or if checkbox "Remove quotes?" was checked), now it capitalizes headers even with quote signs.

- "Print to Terminal" now cleans previous text in the console before outputting a new one.

## v1.0 May 19, 2025
